        <h2 class="blogs">Welcome to the blog</h2>
        <p> Hey internet stranger. Welcome to my blog. I am not sure how or why you ended up here, but here you are. On my blog. Well here on... my blog... I am going to discuss my journey to learn all three languages mentioned in the header. The header on the blog. Posted below will be the links to all of my posts here on the blog. I am not sure that the subject matter of each blog will follow any sort of template so you will just have to look around and see what each blog on my blog is about it.

        <p>Well here we are. You've found your way to my first blog. Going foreward I guess I will type all of my blogs addressing any potential future readers. Even though I doubt anyone will read this blog, the intro to each blog on my blog will first have a mini blog that is addressing the reader.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not really sure what content to put in here that is very interesting. I guess a bit about my journey here so far. I started on Khan academy a while ago mostly focusing on Java. Yesterday I came back to Khan academy but as it turns out I've forgot a lot of what I learned way back then. SO, I switched lanes and ended up doing HTML and CSS today which was pretty successful. Now I am writing this blog and already the dread of writing a second is setting in. What kind of content will I provide? Is this how influencers feel everyday?</p>

        <p> Howdy blog browser. Welcome to the ssssecond blog on my blog. This one has a snake theme. I decided my second blog would be unrelated and be about my fear of snakes. Ever since I was a child I have been afraid of snakes. There are two specific
instances I think that really catapulted this fear forward into my life.</p>

        <p>Well the first run in with a snake I had was when I was a child. I would say about 5 years old. We lived in the countryside and had a snake find its way into our house. What my mother decided to do was cover it with a bucket and close the door to the room it was in. Then we would wait until my father came home. Well this is what we did. We had it under a bucket and shut the door. Hours later when my dad came home from work he entered the room with the snake, while we all fearfully watched from outside the doorway. He approached the bucket slowly, hand hovering over top. In his other hand he wore a glove and was ready to grab the beast. As he lifted the bucket up from the ground, we all stood agasp. <strong>The snake was gone</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>My second encounter with a snake in my life would be a few years later. This time it was a beast of a different nature. A water snake. I was about 9 years old at the time. We had rented a cottage on the lake in the Muskokas of Ontario. As I sat with my knees in the sand, water ebbing over me, suddenly a water snake appeared in the sand. Before I could react to what I had just seen, the serpent slithered its way across my legs and into the water. Its head bobbing above the water caused my skin to crawl. This foul limbless creature had invaded my personal space and I would not forget it.</p>
